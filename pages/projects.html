On her sixteenth birthday, she must renounce her mortal life, enroll in a witch academy, and swear allegiance to a dark god.

She manages to achieve a small victory , attending both the witch academy and a regular school, remaining close to her loved ones, but the servants of darkness never give up hope of swaying her. Now Sabrina must defend her right to live the life she wants, not the life of those around her.</p>
