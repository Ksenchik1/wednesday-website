                    <h2>About the series</h2>
                    <p class="red-string">Wednesday is an American horror comedy streaming television series, based around the character Wednesday Addams of The Addams Family. Produced by MGM Television, the series premiere on Netflix.</p>
                    <p class="red-string">Wednesday is expelled from her high school after dumping live piranhas into the school's pool while the boys' water poloteam is practicing in retaliation for the team bullying her brother Pugsley. This leads her parents, Gomez and Morticia Addams, to enroll her in Nevermore Academy in Jericho, Vermont, a school for monstrous outcasts once attended by her parents. Wednesday's cold, emotionless personality and her defiant nature make it difficult for her to connect with her schoolmates and cause her to run afoul of the school's principal. However, she discovers she has psychic abilities that help her solve a local murder mystery with the help of Jericho's sheriff.</p>
                    <p class="red-string">In season two, Wednesday returns to prowl the Gothic halls of Nevermore Academy, where fresh foes and woes await. Wednesday must navigate family, friends and old adversaries, propelling her into another year of delightfully dark and kooky mayhem. Armed with her signature razor-sharp wit and deadpan charm, Wednesday is also plunged into a new bone-chilling supernatural mystery.</p>

            <h2>Interesting facts</h2>
            <ul class="fact-list">
                <li>Wednesday wasn't supposed to dance. Wednesday's famous viral dance is entirely the work of Jenna Ortega. The choreographer originally set up a different dance, but Jenna, knowing her character's personality, insisted on something more quirky and unusual. She drew inspiration from 80s gothic punk rockers and movements from old horror movies.</li>
                <li>Although Tim Burton was one of the creators of the original Addams Family, he had never directed a television series or a pilot episode before. "Wednesday" marked his directorial debut in television.</li>
                <li>Christina Ricci has become a different person. The actress who played Wednesday in the 90s movies returned to the series, but in a completely new role - Marilyn Thornhill, a botany teacher. It was a clever move by the creators to please fans.</li>
                <li>Jenna Ortega did not play the cello. All the scenes with the cello were performed by the actors. The background sound was a recording of cellist Tyler Joseph, and Jenna learned to accurately replicate the movements of her hands and bow.</li>
                <li>Why doesn't Wednesday blink? It was Jenna Ortega's idea. She deliberately chose not to blink in the scene to enhance the character's unnatural, eerie aura. It required immense concentration.</li>
